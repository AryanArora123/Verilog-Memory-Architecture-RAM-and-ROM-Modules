# Verilog-Memory-Architecture-RAM-and-ROM-Modules
This project consists of Verilog modules that implement different types of memory components: a single-port RAM, a dual-port RAM, and a ROM (Read-Only Memory)
The testbenches developed are attached alongwith design code of respective modeule.

**The results(combined) have been uploaded in a separate file.**

The project showcases 3 types of memory modules:

# Single-Port RAM
Allows read and write operations through a single address port.
# Dual-Port RAM
Allows simultaneous read and write operations through two separate address ports.
# ROM
Provides read-only access to pre-defined data.
These modules are fundamental components in digital systems, often used in FPGA and ASIC designs for temporary data storage, data manipulation, and fixed data storage, respectively.
